This project revolves around asking a question and receiving a random answer from an array. Simply input your question and click on the **_8ball icon_**. The answer is going to appear under the question. To bring this to life, I utilized _JavaScript_ for functionality, _CSS_ for styling, and _HTML_ for structure.
